It encompasses the interactive visual components for d.ASH's software and displays different elements for users to interact with to control your robot. This section of the d.ASH SDK documentation provides details about setting up the d.ASH autonomy controller, including information on its respective components. Main Components Main toolbar : Used to open other menus. Slider : Used to move floor grid up and down. Access mode : Used switch to mouse/keyboard mode. Navigation : The default mode uses the keys WASD to move camera and right click the mouse to zoom/tilt the camera. Waypoint creation : Used for adding waypoints to routes. Floor grid Login The login icon allow dConstruct users to log into the d.ASH autonomy controller using their cloud admin credentials. Robot Connection The robot connection icon allow users to connect/disconnect their respective robots to the d.ASH autonomy controller. Online pannel : Select from a list of robots that are online and ready to be used to connect to. Connected pannel : Select from a list of robots that you have connected to in the client to manipulate. Add button : Press to connect to the robot selected in the online list to add the robot to the connected list. Minus button : Press to disconnect from a robot in the connected list. When users first start the d.ASH SDK, they need to give an initial estimation of the robot's post on the map by configuring its init pose . It tells the robot where its rough initial position is. To initialize init pose , draw the orange arrow by left clicking and drag the mouse on the floor grid. Routes The routes icon allow users to set routes for the robot to follow using waypoints. Add/remove waypoints to build your own custom routes. Route Controls Route name pannel : Enter route name to add. Add button : Click to add route of given name. Route selection pannel : Click to select a route. Minus button : Click to remove selected route. Waypoint button : Click to add waypoints to selected route. Load/save button : Load/save all routes. Segment pannel : Use keypad \u00b1 to increment/decrement segment number. Setting Up Routes To make a selected robot follow a selected route, add waypoints by clicking on the grid. Use WASD and right-click on the mouse to manipulate the view. Once the waypoints have been set, exit waypoint mode by middle clicking the mouse. On the other hand, to remove a waypoint, click on the waypoint (selected waypoint change to the color orange), and press the delete ket to remove. You can also adjust the elevation of the grid by pressing the key ctrl and the mouse scroll moving the floor grid in waypoint mode. A waypoint is created when you click on grid, so, to create elevated waypoints, move grid up/down and then click. Map Settings The map settings icon allow users to adjust highpass, lowpass, UV Scale, and UV offset settings to customise the visuals of your map. Low pass slider : Voxels below this value is visible. Voxels in maps have elevation, and by lowering the low pass, voxels above the low pass will be cropped. Notice that the ceiling voxels have now been cropped by reducing the low pass. Layer Visibility The layer visibility icon allow users to toggle the visibility of various items on the map. Load Scans The load scans icon allow users to preview scans from the d.ASH Pack. Vox downsample size pannel : Select your down sample size (in metres). A large value means lower quality, but faster loading. Point clouds button : Pick loaded point clouds to toggle translucency. Load scans in translucent mode.","title":"d.ASH Autonomy Controller"},{"location":"getting-started/UE-client/#dash-autonomy-controller","text":"As mentioned previously, the d.ASH autonomy controller is the GUI (graphical user interface) for the d.ASH SDK.

RealsenseCam, TestCam . retrieveImg : Enables image retrieval. map_name : Map name used for autonomy (as mentioned in File Organisation ). pc_topic : ROS point cloud topic name for subscribing. odom_topic : ROS odometry topic name for subscribing. 3.2.2 Controller linear_window : Sets DWA (dynamic window approach) size For the following parameters, ensure the value is within limits of the robot. linear_min_v : Sets minimum linear velocity for autonomy. linear_max_v : Sets maximum linear velocity for autonomy. angular_max_w : Sets maximum angular velocity for autonomy. linear_max_a : Sets maximum linear acceleration for autonomy. angular_max_a : Sets maximum angular acceleration for autonomy. For the following parameters, ensure the vlaues are align with the robot as per its documentation. robot_width : Reflects width of robot. robot_length : Reflects the length of robot. obstacle_cost_gains : Sets weight for an obstacle course based on the weighted sum of the map. speed_cost_gains : Sets weight for speed cost. goal_cost_gains : Sets weight for goal cost. angular_speed_cost_scaling_factor : Sets weight for angular velocity. Note that a higher value of the variable discourages the robot from turning. Note that a higher value of the variable slows down the computations. linear_num_window_steps : Sets number of linear velocity values to consider. angular_num_window_steps : Sets number of angular velocity values to consider. prediction_window : Sets prediction horizion (in seconds). costmap_size : Sets local costmap size (in meters). costmap_scale : Sets scale to convert map from meter to pixels. Note that the point cloud height is measured from the center of the lidar. If the ground is detected, it will be considered as an obstacle. Therefore, set the minimum value to be above the ground. max_pc_height : Sets maximum point cloud height to be considered as an obstacle. min_pc_height : Sets minimum point cloud height to be considered as an obstacle. Do not remove too much from the point cloud filter as obstacles around the robot might not be considered. x_filter : Sets vector of size 2 consisting the minimum and maximum x-value of point cloud to be removed. y_filter : Sets vector of size 2 consisting the minimum and maximum y-value of point cloud to be removed. Note that a higher value of the variable results in more conservative planning. costmap_obs_inflation : Sets inflation radius of obstacles to be considered in planning. occ_obs_deadzone : Sets minimum distances from obstacles and robots for autonomy. dt : Sets timestep. Note that a higher timestamp slows down the computation. visualise : Enables visualisation of costmap. This is used only for debugging. 3.2.3 State Estimator initial_x : Sets initialization of x-axis for localizaition (in meters). initial_y : Sets initialization of y-axis for localizaition (in meters). initial_z : Sets initialization of z-axis for localizaition (in meters). initial_w : Sets initialization of orientation for localizaition. kImuTopic : ROS IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) topic name for subscribing. kPoseTopic : Enables localization result. ktfUpdate : Sets ROS tf publishing frequency. kStatusUpdate : Sets localisation status of publishing frequency. kLoggingUpdate : Sets data logging period. kposeDiffmax : Sets the maximum distance between two consecutive pose estimation. KUse_imu_ori : Enables IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) or odom orientation for odometry estimation.

Note that a lower index slows down the movement of the robot. Similarly, a higher index results in the robot not follow path properly. enable_self_rotate : Enables one round of rotation around the robot itself before performing autonomy. This is to ensure that localisation is working before starting autonomy. self_rotation_speed : Sets angular velocity of robot to turn around itself before performing autonomy (in radiants/second). self_rotation_speed_final : Sets angular velocity of robot to turn around itself after performing autonomy (in radiants/second).

Run the following command replacing <username> with your chosen username and <password> with your chosen password. $ ./setServerPassNative -u <username> -p <password> For example, if your username is user123 and your password is ilovedASH , your commands would look like this: $ ./ setServerPassNative - u user123 - p ilovedASH Username in Robot Configuration Please ensure that the username for the d.ASH server is the same as the one defined in the robot configuration file - robotConfig.json . For example, you would set \"username\" : \"<username>\" . 2.2 Robot Registration To register the payload computer with d.ASH's backend system, you will need to by run the file: register_bot_native . However, you will first need to configure the registerBot.json found in the config folder of the SDK. Set <robot_name> to any name you like, and set <robot _username> to your dConstruct cloud admin username. For example, if your robot name is robot1 and your cloud admin user name is user123 , your registerBot.json would look like this: { RobotName: robot1, RobotUserName: user123 } Now, run the following command to register your robot: register_bot_native -i ../config/registerBot.json 2.3 ROS Driver Credentials To set up the local credentials for the ROS driver, you will need to by run the file: setAutonomyCred . Run the following command replacing <username> with your cloud admin username and <password> with your cloud admin password. cd ./ setAutoCred / build ./ setAutonomyCred - u < username > For example, if your username is user123 , your command would look like this: cd ./ setAutoCred / build ./ setAutonomyCred - u user123 - p ilovedASH You will then be prompted to enter a .

This section of the d.ASH SDK documentation provides details about setting up the d.ASH VPN. 4.1 Setting Up VPN Onboard Computer To start, you will need to install some packages to configure automatic VPN connection on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS by executing the following command: sudo apt install network - manager - openvpn network - manager - openvpn - gnome openvpn openvpn - systemd - resolved - y This will install an openvpn package, which creates a /etc/openvpn/client/ directory into which you can place the OpenVPN client configuration file. You will need to configure the VPN configuration file - client.ovpn which can be found in your vpn folder /dash_sdk/vpn . To do so, run the following command: dash-sdk/ \u2514\u2500 vpn/ \u2514\u2500 client.ovpn \u2514\u2500 ca.crt \u2514\u2500 <user>.crt \u2514\u2500 <user>.key Note that <user> in this instance is replaced by your dConstruct admin username. Now, you will need to copy client.ovpn and your user certifications - ca.crt , <user>.crt , <user>.key - into the new open-vpn directory.
